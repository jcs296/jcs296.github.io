This book acts as an \"opinionated guide to being a scientist using modern iternet-enabled research, teaching, publishing, and communication tools\" according to Leek's own words.  In the course of his writing, Leek covers a series of major points:\n\n* Paper Writing\n* Publishing\n* Peer Review\n* Data Sharing\n* Scientific Blogging\n* Scientific Code\n* Social Media in Science\n* Teaching in Science\n* Books\n* Internal Scientific Communication\n* Scientific Talks\n* Reading Scientific papers\n* Credit\n* Career Planning\n* Online Identity\n\nHere, I will provide a brief overview of my personal thoughts on each section.\n\n# Paper Writing\n\nA major point that Leek makes regarding the paper writing process that I haven't greatly considered is the use of collaborative writing software in order to minimize versioning issues.  Most papers I have been involved with were primarily produced using Microsoft Word, and some more recent work has been produced involving the use of Google Docs.  I personally never greatly considered the importance of versioning of documents, but especially when there are more authors, being able to version can have both important credit and information sharing ramifications, so I will pay more attention to this process.  Additionally, Leek calls out [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) and [ShareLatex](https://www.sharelatex.com/) as useful typesetting software that allow use of LaTeX in a more Google Docs-y way.  I will consider looking into these in the future, as I am planning to start exploring the use of LaTeX more in my writing over the next few years.\n\n# Publishing\n\nTwo major points stood out to me in this section.  First, release prints in open access format.  Second, share preprints of papers.  While I wholeheartedly agree with making papers open access (accessibility of information is important in science afer all!), the point about sharing preprints can be complicated, as preprint publication functionally amounts to public commons release of papers, which can have problematic consequences in some countries and at some institutions.  Ultimately, I will probabbly err on the side of talking to appropriate parties for guidance when I am in situations where preprint release may cause issues.  But in general, I do agree that preprint release can be useful for the general public when it is possible.\n\n# Peer Review\n\nWhen you are asked to peer review, do it quickly, or quickly decline.  When you do review, evaluate the quality of the methods and data, whether the data justify the results, and how important the claims are.  I personally think that it is useful to have the guidelines of a 1 month turnaround as Leek suggests as it can be challenging to have a good understanding of good timelines without insight of more senior authors.  While I have gotten to see the inside of the peer review process before, getting some clearer guidelines about the proccess are especially useful in my opinion.\n\n# Data Sharing\n\nLeek argues that data should be made available when the associated paper is published.  I generally agree, but with a major asterisk.  While the reproducibility crisis has been harrowing for biologists especially, the problem of clinical samples can quickly become problematic.  RNA seq data from a mouse should assuredly be published automatically, but results that have the potential of being traced back to a patient could be problematic for them or their families, especially if bad actors in the political, data brokerage, or health insurance realms succeed in re-identifying data.  As is, data privacy is underprotected in the United States (where I am), and so clinical subjects aren't protected from those bad actors.  Until better frameworks are put in place to protect data, clinical data that has the potential of being connected back to the person should maybe be held in more cautious hands.  Otherwise, Data sharing should be a priority.\n\n# Scientific Blogging\n\nWell, I guess that is partially what I am doing now.\n\nUltimately, scientific blogging has 2 major tracts according to Leek.  Either you use it to respond to criticism of your work, or you use it to raise your profile.  I'd probably prefer to use it to raise my profile, but we will see.  Being able to put a face to a name in science is important, as the list of authors on a paper isn't just a group of robots, and so blogging helps to personalize the people behind those papers.\n\n# Scientific Code\n\nDistribute your code publicly and freely.  While Leek gets into the importance of simple code and literate programming, the biggest point is to make code behind analysis freely available.  A point that I think should have been made more prominently was to also make code more readable to less code-literate individuals.  While this is changing, even during my undergrad education (2016-2020) we never touched code, and I've heard that even many recent Ph.D.s don't get training in how to read and use code.  If they need to read your code, they wouldn't be able to read it.  This also maybe gets at issues with some coding languages being obtuse to understand, but an important part of scientific code reproducability is that people with minimal training should be able to relatively quickly figure out what a chunk of code does.\n\n# Social Media in Science\n\nI don't think that this section aged very well. Leek argues for use of social media for networking and for communication of work, and to avoid hot button topics.  The problem I take with this is that major changes have happened in the world of social media since 2016.  Twitter was bought by Elon Musk and has seen a mass exodus.  Regulatory changes internationally have had numerous impacts on the algorithms of social media.  COVID19 made scientists the cultural firestorm for 3 years.  While I do think that scientists have their place in social media, I think that the space is not as healthy as it was 8 years ago.  Hopefully this improves, however.\n\n# Teaching in Science\n\n\n\nThe book can be found at [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/modernscientist) and at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/How-modern-scientist-Jeffrey-Leek-ebook/dp/B01E0EON7W) in ebook format for $10 USD.\n\n",
